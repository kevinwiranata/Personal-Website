## Why did I make this?
Fun project over the 2019-2020 short winter break (thanks quarter system).

## What tech stack did I use?
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - I personally really like react, pretty neat and solid framework.
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - I used netlify to host my site, it's sweet cuz it has continous CI/CD and has built-in form handling so I don't have to hassle with Node.js or PHP.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Although old classic boostrap never fails to dissapoint, I didn't use everything it had to offer, I only took snippets from their CSS framework and wrote a bunch of my own css (for customization).

## How can I run this on my local machine? 
Simply clone this repo and run it!
``` 
git clone https://github.com/kevinwiranata/Personal-Website.git
cd Personal-Website
npm start
```
